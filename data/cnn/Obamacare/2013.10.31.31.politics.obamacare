<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.0">Out of the political frying pan and into the partisan fire for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.1">A day after apologizing and taking responsibility for the problem-plagued Obamacare website, Sebelius got subpoenaed on Thursday by one of the fiercest Republican critics of the administration -- House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.2">Issa told CNN that the subpoena demands documents and information relating to the HealthCare.gov website that his committee previously requested from Sebelius, adding she "answered some questions but evaded a great many."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.3">"Now we really need to insist on those documents," he said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.4">A spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department noted last week that Issa's committee began requesting a broad range of documents and transcribed interviews during the recent 16-day government shutdown.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.5">"While we are working diligently to satisfy their interest and have repeatedly communicated our intent to cooperate, their timeline was not feasible given the vast scope of their requests," the spokeswoman, Joanne Peters, said Thursday.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.6">"We are disappointed that the committee believes a subpoena was necessary; however it does not change our intent to continue to cooperate with them to produce documents as expeditiously as we are able to," she added.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.7">Meanwhile, some top Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters Thursday to Sebelius and four contractors involved in the website project requesting documents involving security concerns raised at its hearing a day earlier with the Secretary.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.8">It's been almost a month since the website for enrolling in President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms went live. But technical problems, despite a series of advance warning signs, have impeded the system and provoked anger and frustration.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.9">Even after a chorus of apologies out of Washington, it may be another month before everything's running smoothly.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.10">The federal agency that oversees the troubled website announced Thursday it had brought on experts from tech giants Google, Oracle and Red Hat to the team working to fix the problems.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.11">According to a blog post by Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, dozens of people were reinforcing the "tech surge" by the administration working on the website issues.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.12">"They come from leading technology companies such as Red Hat and Oracle, and include individuals with expertise on site reliability; stability; and scalability," Bataille's webpost said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.13">She identified one of the new additions as Michael Dickerson, a site reliability engineer on leave from Google.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.14">On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden became the highest-ranking administration official to apologize for the botched rollout.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.15">"We assumed that it was up and ready to run," he told CNN's sister network HLN. "But the good news is although it's not -- and we apologize for that -- we are confident by the end of November it will be, and there'll still be plenty of time for people to register and get online."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.16">That mea culpa came after Sebelius apologized for the "miserably frustrating" problems during a 3 1/2-hour congressional grilling. She said she made a mistake when she told Obama that HealthCare.gov was "ready to go" for its October 1 launch.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.17">Sebelius promised a "vast majority" of consumers will have an easier time shopping online for health insurance under Obamacare by the end of November.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.18">Analysis: Sebelius deals with a difficult day</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.19">"In these early weeks, access to HealthCare.gov has been a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans, including many who have waited years, in some cases their entire lives, for the security of health insurance," Sebelius said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.20">She echoed the overall administration stance -- that a team of experts is scrambling to fix the website's errors.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.21">To the frustrated users who have had problems, she said: "You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.22">5 things we learned from Sebelius hearing</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.23">Obama tried to log on</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.24">Biden said he didn't even bother logging on to the Obamacare site.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.25">"Actually, the President tried to get online, and my daughter tried to get online," he said. "I did not, because it was clear that I was not getting online."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.26">Obama himself acknowledged that too many people "have gotten stuck, and I am not happy about it."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.27">"There's no excuse for it," the President said. "And I take full responsibility for making sure it gets fixed ASAP."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.28">Glass half full?</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.29">Sebelius said the sweeping health care program has delivered on its promise to provide affordable health care coverage. Thousands have been able to access the website to look at new health coverage options that will give them security of knowing they won't go bankrupt if they get sick, she said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.30">Who is Kathleen Sebelius?</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.31">Republicans have called for Sebelius to be fired for the Obamacare problems, but a White House spokesman said Wednesday that Obama has "complete confidence" in her.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.32">"She took responsibility for many of the problems that are evident with the (Obamacare) website, but she also deserves credit for the other aspects of the Affordable Care Act implementation that have gone well," spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.33">In fact, Obama tried to turn the tables on Republican opponents of his signature health care reforms, challenging them to come up with helpful ideas instead of undermining the federal law.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.34">"Anyone defending the remnants of the old, broken system -- as if it was working for people -- anybody who thinks we shouldn't finish the job of making the health care system work for everybody ... those folks should have to explain themselves," he said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.35">According to the Kaiser Family Foundation website, 15.4 million people had individual health care coverage in 2011, representing about 5% of the population. The vast majority of Americans have coverage through their employer, Medicare, Medicaid or other public providers.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.36">White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that "a significant portion" of the 5% of people with individual coverage will end up paying less for better policies when they shop around in the new exchanges.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.37">Early warning signs</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.38">Some of the criticism surrounding the website's launch has to do with what Obama and other officials knew -- and when they knew it.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.39">CNN has learned the administration received stark warnings a month before the launch that the Obamacare site was not ready to go live, according to a confidential report. The caution, from the main contractor CGI Federal, warned of risks and issues for HealthCare.gov, even as company executives were testifying publicly the project was on track.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.40">Administration was warned before site launch</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.41">Sebelius told the House committee the outside contractors who built the website never recommended delaying this month's launch. But she conceded that "we did not adequately do end-to-end testing."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.42">The contracts with the private companies working on the Obamacare website -- which amount to $174 million so far, with more bills due well into 2014 -- do not have "built-in penalties" allowing her department to charge them for disappointing or faulty work, Sebelius said. But Sebelius said the agency will not pay for incomplete work.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.43">Security questions</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.44">Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, accused Sebelius of putting the private information of Americans at risk by failing to properly test security measures on the website.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.45">"This is a completely unacceptable level of security," he said. "You know it's not secure."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.46">Sebelius responded that testing occurs regularly, and she told Rogers she would get back to him on whether any end-to-end security test of the entire system has ever occurred. Rogers said he knows there have been no such comprehensive security tests.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.47">Memo warned of high security risk at health care website</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.48">An internal government memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday that was written days before the website launched warned of a "high" security risk because of a lack of testing.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.49">"Due to system readiness issues, the (security control assessment) was only partly completed," said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services memo. "This constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the Marketplace Day 1 operations."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.50">Sebelius told CNN last week that Obama didn't know of the problems with the site -- even though insurance companies had complained and the site crashed during a pre-launch test run -- until after it went live.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.51">A senior administration official said Obama now gets a "nightly readout" with the latest Obamacare statistics and an update of the website's status.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.52">More: What else could go wrong with Obamacare?</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2013.10.31.31.politics.obamacare.53">CNN's Brianna Keilar, Joe Johns, Gloria Borger, Kevin Bohn, Lisa Desjardins and Z. Byron Wolf contributed to this report.</paragraph>
