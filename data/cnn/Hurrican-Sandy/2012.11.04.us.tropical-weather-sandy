<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.0">Kevin Cordova's family tried cooking hot food to stay warm. They wore their winter coats inside and buried themselves under blankets.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.1">But on Sunday, six days after powerful winds from Superstorm Sandy knocked out their power, temperatures dipped so low they couldn't spend another night in their home in Floral Park, New York.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.2">"There's really no amount of blankets that can stop you from being cold in 30-degree weather," said Cordova, 28. "We feel a little homeless right now. We have our house, but we can't really use it."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.3">Officials say thousands of New Yorkers left without heat after Superstorm Sandy might need to leave their homes as temperatures plummet, but it's not clear where they'll go.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.4">How you can help people recover</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.5">Between 30,000 and 40,000 people in New York City could need housing, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday. Officials are working on coming up with a solution, he said, but they haven't yet.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.6">"We don't have a lot of empty housing in this city," he said. "We are not going to let anybody go sleeping in the streets. We're not going to let anybody go without blankets, food and water, but it's a challenge and we're working on that."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.7">New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as a "massive housing problem."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.8">The storm that broke records -- and hearts</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.9">"People are in homes that are uninhabitable," Cuomo told reporters. "It's going to become increasingly clear that they're uninhabitable when the temperature drops and the heat doesn't come on."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.10">In Long Island's Nassau County, where 266,000 customers were still without power Sunday, some people have died while trying to heat their homes with propane grills and other improvised methods, County Administrator Edward Mangano said Sunday.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.11">"We've very concerned about people sheltering in places without proper heat," he said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.12">Utility officials warned some residents that it could take until Wednesday for power to be restored, Cordova said. The freelance editor said his family was grateful their house survived the storm, but they're unsure of what to do if their power stays out much longer. On Sunday night, his family planned to stay with friends.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.13">"We're all staying in different houses," he said, "but I don't know how long we can keep that up."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.14">More than 10,000 people across nine states spent Saturday night in shelters, American Red Cross spokeswoman Attie Poirier said. The Red Cross is sending 80,000 blankets to the region ahead of colder weather predicted this week.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.15">"As we move through energy and gasoline, housing is really the No. 1 concern," said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, who spoke in Hoboken, New Jersey.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.17">"And we don't even know yet which of the houses are reparable and which are irreparable losses. Those assessments are going on right now, as well as finding temporary housing for individuals who can't move back to their home right away."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.18">As of Sunday, roughly 182,000 people in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York had applied for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has approved more than $158 million in aid.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.19">In her apartment in Yonkers, New York, Julie Munn huddled under the covers, watching her breath in the air before she went to sleep. Her 6-month-old cat, Sheldon, got skittish, trying to crawl under things to keep warm.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.20">"It got so cold that I left Saturday morning," she said. "It was the same temperature inside the apartment as it was outside."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.21">Munn, 25, who stayed at her parents' house, got word that her power came back Sunday.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.26">Among those still in the dark Sunday was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who urged patience.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.27">"I know it stinks. I still don't have power at my house. I'm not happy about it ... but it's the way it is," he said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.28">Less than a million households in New Jersey were without power Sunday, he said, down from 2.7 million soon after the storm.</paragraph>

Once approved, the voter will be sent an electronic ballot that can, in turn, be e-mailed or faxed back to the county clerk.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.38">She found valuables in the bushes, a generator in the pool and a fish -- still alive -- inside her flooded childhood home. A boat from a nearby canal ended up on a neighbor's lawn.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.04.us.tropical-weather-sandy.39">"It looks like a war zone with people's stuff all out everywhere," said Cristiano, 24.</paragraph>
