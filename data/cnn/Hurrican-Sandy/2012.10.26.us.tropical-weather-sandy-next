<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.0">Slowly but surely, Hurricane Sandy is making its way toward the U.S. East Coast.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.1">Exactly when and where it will hit is unclear. Sandy is a swirl of moving parts and any change in forecast could mean major changes in its impact.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.2">That said, a serious storm is clearly afoot -- and meteorologists are working overtime to track Sandy's progress.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.3">Here are the latest storm predictions from the CNN Weather Unit:</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.4">Saturday</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.5">Sandy, which is over the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida, is expected to continue moving up alongside the East Coast. It will likely weaken to a tropical storm. But don't be fooled; Sandy should strengthen again later in the weekend. Rough seas and surf will be building along the seaboard as far north as North Carolina.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.6">Storm has Northeast in crosshairs</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.7">Sunday</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.8">Heavy rain and strong winds will pound the coastal regions of North Carolina and Virginia as the storm slogs north. Rough seas will stretch up through Delaware and Maryland.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.9">Monday</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.10">Sandy's massive size, coupled with a full moon peaking Monday, will lead to extremely high tides, rough seas and storm surge that will cause beach erosion and flooding.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.12">The mid-Atlantic region will be hit hard, with tropical storm force winds extending from the Carolinas up to Maine.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.14">Tuesday into Wednesday</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.15">Sandy is forecast to move slowly. In spots, its center could linger for as long as 48 hours, unleashing heavy rain from the Great Lakes down to the Mid-Atlantic, through the Northeast.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.16">The strongest winds may not be nearest Sandy's center, as they are with traditional hurricanes.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.10.26.us.tropical-weather-sandy-next.17">On the backside of the storm, record-breaking snow will fall over portions of the Appalachian Mountains, mainly in West Virginia.</paragraph>
